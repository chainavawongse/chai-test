As a software engineer at Ncontracts,
we expect you 
to adhere to a standard we deem appropriate in order for us to deliver quality software on-time and on-budget.
On the surface, this seems easy and a no-brainer. 
But what does this actually mean? 
Let's spell it out.

### Be consistently available and predictable

We have developers across all four time zones. Being available for your teammate during the core hours (link?) is a requirement.

We offer flexible hours, but we also require you to be available during the core hours.

40-hours week is not an option.  

### Communicate often

There is no lone-wolf at Ncontracts.
You are in a squad.
At any given time, your teammates consist of a product person, a QA person, other developers, possibly an UX person. 
We expect you to communicate with your teammates, your managers, and your peers clearly and in a timely fashion.

If you are going to be out, make sure people that rely on you are notified.

If you have questions about the requirements, talk to your product person.

If you wonder why the piece of code you are looking it is so bad and why no one addressed it, talk to your lead to get an explanation.

If you have any question at all, just ask around.  

***The very worst you can do is sit on the unknown and assume***

### Understand the economy of time

Time costs money. Codes that aren't in production are not providing anyone any value.

This is not to say we should rush things out.  

This is a call for us developers to be self-aware so that we can set goals/timelines/milestones appropriately.

### Be kind

Treat others as you want to be treated.  
Use positive language. 
Encourage each other. 
Hold each other accountable.  
Be kind doesn't mean you let someone off the hook when they're obviously doing something wrong.  
Being kind means you address the problem in a way that addressing the problems and not personally attacking others.
