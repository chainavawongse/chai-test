Code reviews are done via a pull requests on GitHub. 

- Every developer at any level is encouraged to review a pull request. Even if you are uncomfortable approving an entire PR, you have a unique perspective and your feedback is valued. Quality is a team effort.
- Be professional and kind when reviewing code and providing feedback. Keep in mind that developers may have different approaches to solving problems. 
- When applicable provide a rationale for your suggestions. A code review is an excellent opportunity to foster knowledge sharing and growth.
- Watch for critical issues, potential bugs, security concerns, performance problems, and coding standards
- Be open to discussions and explanations from the developer. Engage in a constructive dialogue to clarify any questions or concerns.
- If the interaction in the pull request becomes overwhelming, get on a call. A fast feedback loop is what we are after
