As we continue to build new products and new features, it's imperative that we document changes as we go.  Documentation in this context is documentation from developers to developers.  At its core, good documentation helps answering technical question and explain the reasoning behind decisions made at the given time.  It provides context and clarity to other developers that come after you.
