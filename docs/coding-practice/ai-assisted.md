GPT is great. Copilot is helpful.  Please use them if it helps you accomplish your task but keep in mind that these tools often make mistakes. 

Just like copying code from Stack Overflow or from another Ncontracts repository when you choose to use assistance, we will expect that:

- You must understand the code you are committing
- You must be able to explain your code to others
- You have tested it with tests, a test runner (console app) and/or an accompanying UI
