At Ncontracts, fostering seamless and productive communication is key to an efficient working environment.  These
guidelines aim to help developers communicate clearly with others.

## Email

We do communicate via email. It is expected that you check your inbox and response to emails in a timely fashion

1. Check your inbox daily
2. When email requires responses, do so in a timely fashion
   1. Even when you do not have an answer, you are expected to be responsive
3. Beware of Reply All.  Make sure you know who you are sending the email to

## Meetings

1. Respond to meeting invites 
2. Accept the invite if you are planning to attend the meeting
3. Decline the invite If you cannot attend the meeting
4. If you are invited to a meeting and don't understand why, respond and ask, and then decide whether to accept or decline. 
5. Be on-time and prepared for the meeting

## Microsoft Teams

Teams is the primary communication channel within the squad, R&D, and Customer Success.  You may have been added to many channels and group chats.

1. Make sure you are added to necessary channels
2. Manage notifications so you don't get overwhelmed with notifications
3. Tag people in the message if you need to get their attention
4. Direct messages or group chats are good and effective way to communicate among your team. However, when the discussions are expanded to broader technical topics (application architectures, performance improvements, security, etc.) or broader product-related topics (what does this button do, why are we even implementing the feature, this requirement doesn't make sense, etc.) please make this discussion public.   

    ### Making Discussion Public 
		 
    - Use the Teams' channels rather than group chats 
    - Tag your leads and follow up 
    - The goal is to clarify any ambiguity and be on the same page across the board 

## Teams Meetings

1. If you are on a call and there are less than 5-7 people, you should try to have your video on and stay off of mute. its helpful for everyone, makes it easier to create relationships, and makes talking more natural. Additionally, if you're expecting to participate by talking in a meeting of any size, have your camera on. Obviously there are exceptions, and valid reasons to have your camera off, but it should be an exception 
2. Minimize distractions (background, noise)
