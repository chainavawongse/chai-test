# Repository Ownership & Responsibility

The repo owner is responsible for the well-being of the repo.
Since other teams may push code to any repo, it's very important that the repo owners are aware of changes being made.

- Actively participate in the pull request, especially when the PR comes from other teams.
- Keeping main updated with releases
- Keeping dependencies up to date
- Delete unused, merged, closed branches
- Use CODEOWNERS file to help with tagging the repo owner on pull requests
