Before you start working in other teams' repo, please

- Have a quick chat with the repo owner about what you are trying to do
- Understand the architecture and patterns being used.  Things are what they are for a reason.  It's okay to improve upon it but understanding how and why the code gets there will give you more context while working in that code base.
